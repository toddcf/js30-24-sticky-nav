# JavaScript30 #24: Sticky Nav

When user scrolls down so that the navbar reaches the top of the page, it becomes fixed to the top of the page.

A padding-top of equivalent height is added to the container below the nav to compensate for the nav being removed from the flow.

A logo is animated in from the left when the nav becomes fixed.

The main text container becomes slightly larger when the nav becomes fixed.

All of this is reversed when the user scrolls back down.
